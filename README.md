# random-csv-parser

This is an answer for a unit test I attempted at an interview to test my knowlege on Node js. The question is pasted below:

REQUIREMENTS
Your task is to:
  ● Parse the data in the CSV
  ● Create a simple command line application (using Node.js) to filter and select a random item
    from the CSV.
    ○ You are required to dynamically extract the headers of the CSV
  ● Finally, once you have a selected item, you need to output the value from the first column of the
    CSV to the console.
* Kindly note that the same code base needs to work with both CSVs without needing to edit it.
* Your code will be tested with different data to what was provided, so make sure it is as dynamic as
  possible.

See the screenshot below for an example of the applications usage (this example was created using the
data in the CSV on people):
